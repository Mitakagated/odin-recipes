    <h2>Swirled Bulgarian Banitsa</h2>
    <p>A classic Swirled Banitsa! A recipe for a fluffy, soft and very tasty Banitsa with cheese, served with delight to the whole family!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For the Stuffing</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>100-200g cheese</li>
        <li>1 teacup yogurt</li>
        <li>1/2 - 1 teacup oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Universal Pastry and Pizza Dough</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1L lukewarm water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cube of fresh yeast</li>
        <li>around 1/2 teacup oil</li>
        <li>to 2kg flour (as long as it takes to roll the dough)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>You mix the ingredients for the filling, first beating the eggs, then adding the rest of the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Mix the flour ingredients into a smooth dough. Divide into 4 balls. Only 1 ball is used for the Banitsa and the rest is frozen in the freezer. When you want to eat of Banitsa or pizza again (1 scoop makes about 2 medium-sized pizzas), simply defrost, grind, bake and eat. It also works with ready-made dough.</li>
        <li>1/4 of the dough is used for the Banitsa. After mixing the dough well, divide it into 4 balls. Roll out each ball and sprinkle with the filling, roll up and place in a greased pan. This is repeated with each peel.</li>
        <li>When you are finished, pour the remaining filling on the rolled Banitsa and leave it to rise for 30 minutes. Then we bake at 220 degrees celsius. After it is baked, it is smeared with oil, and you can also steam it a little.</li>
    </ol>
