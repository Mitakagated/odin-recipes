    <h2>Some words about the recipe</h2>
    <p>At home, making Moussaka is a small celebration. Everyone loves it and eats it with pleasure!</p>
    <p>Although we put some yogurt in the topping, as you can see from the photo, the topping is thin and its flavor only accentuates the flavor of the moussaka. In some recipes, the filling is very thick, which is not a problem for me, but for other people it may be, because the taste of the filling itself is felt more. I am sure you will like the recipe.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>500g minced meat 60/40 (pork/beef)</li>
        <li>1.2kg potatoes</li>
        <li>4 small carrots or 2-3 big ones</li>
        <li>2 onions</li>
        <li>2 red peppers</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon tomato puree</li>
        <li>50ml oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon savory</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the topping</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>300g yogurt</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons flour</li>
        <li>200g cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>The preparation of the products requires about 20 minutes. We start by cutting the vegetables - carrots, onions, peppers. I use a chopper for onions and carrots to save time. I cut the pepper into cubes. I stew with only 200 ml of water (without frying with oil to make the feast healthier) first the onions and carrots for 10 minutes, then I add the peppers for another 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>After the vegetables are soft, add the minced meat and the spices - savory, red and black pepper. Add the tomato puree. We leave the salting for the end before putting the Moussaka to roast.</li>
        <li>The next step after the heat treatment of the minced meat and vegetables is the addition of the diced potatoes. Add the oil. They are mixed with the minced meat and vegetables in the pot and stewed for no more than 5 minutes. This is the moment when I add the salt - to taste.</li>
        <li>Pour everything into a pan and add 300 milliliters of water. Bake in an oven preheated to 180 degrees. We watch for a pleasant reddening of the potatoes and minced meat, as well as for the water to come out of the mixture. If you prefer the Moussaka a little juicier, do not let the water boil completely, so even after it cools, the dish will remain juicy.</li>
        <li>Time to make the topping for the Moussaka. Beat all the listed ingredients - Eggs, yogurt, milk, flour and grated cheese, until a homogeneous mixture. Pour and spread over the entire surface of the moussaka. Return to the oven to bake to a light golden crust. Do not overcook the topping so that it remains soft, fluffy and juicy</li>
    </ol>
