    <h2>Some words about the recipe</h2>
    <p>At home, making Moussaka is a small celebration. Everyone loves it and eats it with pleasure!</p>
    <p>Although we put some yogurt in the topping, as you can see from the photo, the topping is thin and its flavor only accentuates the flavor of the moussaka. In some recipes, the filling is very thick, which is not a problem for me, but for other people it may be, because the taste of the filling itself is felt more. I am sure you will like the recipe.</p>
